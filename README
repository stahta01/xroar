XRoar - a Dragon and Tandy 8-bit computer emulator
Copyright 2003-2021 Ciaran Anscomb <xroar@6809.org.uk>


Introduction
============

XRoar emulates the Dragon 32/64; Tandy Colour Computers 1, 2 and 3; the
Tandy MC-10; and some other similar machines or clones.  It runs on a
wide variety of platforms.  Emulated hardware includes:

   * Dragon 32, 64, and 200-E; Tandy CoCo 1, 2, & 3; Tandy MC-10.
   * DragonDOS, Delta and RS-DOS disk controller cartridges.
   * Orchestra 90-CC stereo sound cartridge.
   * Games Master Cartridge, including the SN76489 sound chip.
   * Glenside IDE cartridge, with IDE hard disk image support.
   * NX32 and MOOH RAM expansions, with SPI and SD card image support.

   Other features include:

   * Raw and translated keyboard modes.
   * Read and write tape images (compact '.cas' files or audio, e.g.
     '.wav').
   * Read and write VDK, JVC and DMK format floppy disk images.
   * Becker port for communication with remote servers.
   * Save and load machine snapshots.
   * GDB target for remote debugging.

   XRoar is easily built from source under Linux, and binary packages
are provided for Mac OS X and Windows.

   XRoar can also be compiled to WebAssembly, and redistributing it in
this form may provide a convenient way for users to run your Dragon
software.  See XRoar Online (https://www.6809.org.uk/xroar/online/) for
an example.

contain the full manual as a PDF, which is also available from the XRoar
home page (https://www.6809.org.uk/xroar/).

Notes for version 1.x
=====================

Version 1.x comes with support for two new emulated machines: the Tandy
Colour Computer 3 and the Tandy MC-10.  Some major changes have taken
place under the hood, and although most things should remain familiar,
for some special uses, here are the things you need to know.

   Snapshots now store much more state, and of course support the new
emulated machines, but this means the format had to change.  Snapshots
from the last 0.x release are still recognised, and can be loaded, but
this support is likely to be removed in time.

   The tape emulation now supports manual pause control.  On the MC-10,
this defaults to paused, as it has no ability to remotely control the
tape motor.  You will need to un-pause after typing 'CLOAD' or 'CLOADM'
on the MC-10 (File -> Cassette -> Play, or from the tape control tool;
autorunning will do this automatically).

   Previously, the Glenside IDE controller would use a fixed HD image
file in the current working directory called 'hd0.img'.  You must now
specify an image with the '-load-hd0' option.  There is also the new
ability to attach a _second_ hard disk image with '-load-hd1', if you
have software that can access it.

   Similarly, the NX32 and MOOH cartridges would use a fixed SD image
file, and you must now specify it with the '-load-sd' option.


Installation
************

Binary packages
===============

Pre-built binary packages are available from the XRoar home page
(https://www.6809.org.uk/xroar/).  If one is not available for your
architecture, you will need to build from source.  XRoar should build
and run on any POSIX-like system for which SDL version 2 is available.

   You will also need BASIC ROM images--binary dumps of the firmware
from an original machine.  The originals were part-written by Microsoft,
so they are not distributed in the XRoar packages.

Mac OS X binary package
-----------------------

Download and unzip the appropriate '.zip' distribution for your system.
Drag the application icon to '/Applications/'.

   For troubleshooting or testing options, it's often a good idea to run
from the command line, but application packages don't make that trivial.
A symbolic link to somewhere in your 'PATH' is all that's required.
e.g.:

     $ sudo ln -s /Applications/XRoar.app/Contents/MacOS/xroar \
             /usr/local/bin/xroar

   After this, you can start the emulator by simply typing 'xroar'
followed by any command line options.

   ROM images should be placed in a directory you create under your
'HOME' named '~/Library/XRoar/roms/' (not the system directory,
'/Library/').  Name any configuration file you create
'~/Library/XRoar/xroar.conf'.

   The Mac OS X build provides a menu for access to certain features,
and often accepts the more familiar '<Command>+KEY' in place of the
'<CTRL>+KEY' shortcuts listed in this manual.

Windows binary package
----------------------

Download and unzip the appropriate '.zip' distribution for your system.

   The easiest way forward is to simply put ROM images into the
directory created when you unzip the distribution, and then run the
'.exe' straight from there.  You can also put any configuration file
('xroar.conf') here.

   However, if you want to avoid having to move files around each time
you upgrade, you can create 'Documents/XRoar' to contain your
configuration file, and a subdirectory of that, 'Documents/XRoar/roms'
for ROM images.

   Note when troubleshooting that the logging from the Windows binary is
probably only going to be visible if you run it with the '-C' option
(must be the first option) to allocate a console.

   The Windows build provides menu-based access to certain features.

Building from source
====================

Dependencies
------------

If there is no binary package for your system, you will have to build
from source.  XRoar can use various backend toolkits, and you will need
to ensure you have their development files installed.  If you're using
Debian, this can (at the time of writing) be achieved with the following
simple command:

     $ sudo apt install build-essential libsndfile1-dev libgtk2.0-dev \
             libgtkglext1-dev libasound2-dev

   Under Mac OS X, first be sure to install Apple's Xcode
(https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) package.  The easiest way to then
ensure you have XRoar's dependencies available is to use a system like
Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) or MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/).  For
Homebrew, the following command will install the required dependencies:

     $ brew install libsndfile sdl2

   Otherwise, you'll have to do a bit of platform-specific research to
ensure you have all the dependencies for a full build:

   GTK+ (http://www.gtk.org/), the GIMP toolkit, provides the most
full-featured user interface.  It is only usable as such if you also
have GtkGlExt (http://projects.gnome.org/gtkglext/), an OpenGL extension
used to provide video output.  Otherwise, it can provide a file
requester for use by other user interfaces.  Version 2 only.

   SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/), Simple Directmedia Layer, provides a
slightly more basic user experience.  Menus are added using native code
under Mac OS X and Windows; any other target using SDL will support only
keyboard shortcuts.  Unless you are building for Linux, SDL is required
to use joysticks.  Version 2 required.

   POSIX Regular Expressions are used in option parsing, so TRE
(https://laurikari.net/tre/about/) is required on non-POSIX platforms
(e.g.  Windows).

   Other supported audio APIs: OSS, ALSA, PulseAudio, CoreAudio.  Some
other options are still in the code base, but have not been tested in a
while.

   libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/) is recommended to
enable support for using audio files as cassette images.

Compilation
-----------

Once you have the dependencies, building XRoar follows a familiar
procedure:

     $ gzip -dc xroar-1.0.6.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     $ cd xroar-1.0.6
     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ sudo make install

   The 'configure' script has a lot of options guiding what it tests
for, specifying cross-compilation, changing the install path, etc.  List
them all with the '--help' option.

   By default, 'configure' will set up an install _prefix_ of
'/usr/local', but this can be changed by using the '--prefix=PATH'
option.

   Once built, run 'make install' as root (or use 'sudo', as in the
example above) to install the binary and info documentation on your
system.  The executable is called 'xroar'.  ROM images should be placed
either in your home directory as '~/.xroar/roms/', or under the
installation _prefix_ as '_prefix_/share/xroar/roms/'.  Any
configuration file should be created as '~/.xroar/xroar.conf'.

   XRoar can be built on one platform to run on another.  The Windows
binary package is built like this.  To specify a cross-compile, use the
'--host=HOST' argument to 'configure'.  For example, to build for
Windows, you might use './configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32'.  Getting
everything _just so_ for a cross-build can be a tricky procedure, and
the details are beyond the scope of this manual.

   XRoar can be built to a WebAssembly target using Emscripten
(https://emscripten.org/).  With the SDK installed, run 'emconfigure
./configure --enable-wasm' to set up the build environment.  Build with
'emmake make'.  HTML/JavaScript and CSS examples for interfacing to the
output are included in the 'wasm/' subdirectory.
